# LU Lab Preprints

Publishing research papers at international conferences is often a challenge for researchers in Myanmar, including those of us at the Language Understanding (LU) Lab. To share our work more openly and make our research accessible, we have decided to publish some of our R&D outputs as preprints, with the help of platforms such as [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org).

This repository includes:

- Preprint papers from LU Lab
- Source files used in preparing the papers (e.g., LaTeX, Microsoft Word)
- Experimental notes, code, and datasets (as much as we are able to share)

We hope this repository serves as a helpful resource for the research community and encourages more open sharing of scientific work.
