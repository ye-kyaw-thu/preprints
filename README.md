# LU Lab Preprints

Publishing research papers at international conferences is often a challenge for researchers in Myanmar, including those of us at the Language Understanding (LU) Lab. In 2025, we decided to share our work more openly by publishing some of our R&D outputs as preprints, with the help of platforms such as [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org).

This repository includes:

- Preprint papers from LU Lab
- Source files used in preparing the papers (e.g., LaTeX, Microsoft Word)
- Experimental notes, code, and datasets (as much as we are able to share)

We hope this repository serves as a helpful resource for the research community and encourages more open sharing of scientific work.
